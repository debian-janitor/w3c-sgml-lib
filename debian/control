Description: w3.org DTD and catalog files
 This package consists of all the definition files used by the 
 W3C Markup Validator. It consists of DTDs and modules, entity files
 and XML and SGML catalogs. The catalogs are registered with the root
 catalogs.
 .
 Since the files come from the W3C they layout is different from the
 w3c-dtd-xhtml package. However in an effort to maintain backwards
 compatibility there are symbolic links to best matches. These are not
 referenced by the catalog files and will be removd in a leter release.
