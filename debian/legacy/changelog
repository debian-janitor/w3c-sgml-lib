w3c-dtd-xhtml (1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Package upload sponsored by Adam di Carlo
  * Use the debian/compat file instead of DH_COMPAT for debhelper
    compatibility mode
  * Use new dh_installcatalogs, requires debhelper (>= 4.1.31)
  * We don't build the symlinks under /usr/share/sgml anymore, so
    we don't need to build-depends on sgml-data
  * debian/rules: removed useless commands

  * Initial release, closes: Bug#139058

      - replaced all SGMLDECL in catalogs by DTDDECL
      - reorganised files so that they fit in the Debian /usr/share/sgml 
        directory structure
      - added generic (unofficial) mappings in addition to those provided,
        see /usr/share/sgml/html/dtd/xhtml/catalog.
